---

A couple of times a month, usually the middle two/three Sundays, we have separate activities for young people during part of the Sunday morning service, with the opportunity to explore Christianity in the context of the issues they face as young adults today.

4:12 is for young people aged 11+ and the groupâ€™s name refers to a verse in the Bible which says:

<div class="well">
"Let no one despise your youth; instead, you should be an example to the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."

<div style="text-align: right">1 Timothy 4v12</div>
</div>

The group has great discussions on interesting and challenging topics ... and lots of fun.
