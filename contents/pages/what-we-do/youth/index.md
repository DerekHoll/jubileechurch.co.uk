There has been a long history of youth work on the site of the [Jubilee Centre](/pages/find-and-contact-us/#the-jubilee-centre), stretching back to the 1920s!

Today there are a number of different activities and events that are available for young people. Recess is [our Friday night youth club](#recess) for any young people in the community. 4:12 is for young people that want to be part of Jubilee church, and meets [during Sunday morning meetings](#sundays). We also join with [other churches in the area](/pages/who-we-are/#our-connections) for joint services, [worship events](#identity) and going to festivals like Soul Survivor. All our leaders have been [DBS checked and follow safeguarding policies](/pages/what-we-do/children-and-families/#safeguarding).
