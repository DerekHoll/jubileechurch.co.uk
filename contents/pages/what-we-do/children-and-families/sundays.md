### Crèche (0-4 Year Olds)

A supervised crèche is available on during most Sunday morning services. Little ones can play together in a relaxed and fun environment and begin to discover who God is.  There are lots of toys to play with as well as different activities to join in with such as stories, songs, drawing, painting, sticking, jumping...

### Jubilee Kids (4-10 Year Olds)

During most church services on Sunday mornings, children spend some of the morning in their own group. We meet in one of the large rooms upstairs, which is equipped with comfy seating and bean bags. Jubilee Kids is a place where children can discover more about God in a fun environment. We love to learn from stories in the bible, pray together, get crafty and play lots of games.
