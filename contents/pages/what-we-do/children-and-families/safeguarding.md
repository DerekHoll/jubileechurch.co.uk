Jubilee Church takes the safeguarding of children and young people very seriously and our safeguarding policy is available on request. Safeguarding training is provided for all trustees, leaders, staff and volunteers, we are putting in place processes known as 'safer recruitment' and volunteers and staff working with children and/or young people have undergone a Disclosure & Baring Service (DBS) check as appropriate.
