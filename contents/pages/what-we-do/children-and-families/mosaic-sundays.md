On the last Sunday of each month, we start with refreshments at 10.00am, followed by a shorter service with a focus on worship for all ages at 10.30am. We call these our Mosaic Sundays, reflecting the fact that our church is made up from individuals of different ages, backgrounds and personalities â€“ but like individual pieces of pottery or glass, each time we come together we make up a beautiful and colourful mosaic! These services tend to be a little bit different, but are always lots of fun and very refreshing.
