Walk past the Jubilee Centre on a Sunday morning and the chances are that you may see or even hear us spending time together worshipping God. Our friendly and informal services start at 10.00am and are followed by the chance to chat over a cup of tea or coffee. We sing songs to praise and thank God, pray together and individually and learn more about living our lives for God.  

Children spend some of the morning in their [own groups](/pages/what-we-do/children-and-families/#sundays), learning stories from the Bible and having fun with arts and crafts. A supervised cr√®che is also available where little ones can play together in a relaxed and fun environment. A couple of times a month, we also have [separate activities for teenagers](/pages/what-we-do/youth/#sundays), with the opportunity to explore Christianity in the context of the issues they face as young adults today.
