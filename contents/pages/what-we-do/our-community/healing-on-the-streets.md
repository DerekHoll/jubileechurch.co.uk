[Healing on the Streets Bromley](http://www.streethealingbromley.org/) is a group of ordinary people, from a number of churches and denominations in the Bromley area, who follow Jesus. We believe God loves everyone and that one of the ways in which He can demonstrate that love is through His power to heal. Our aim is to be available, on a regular basis in Bromley High Street, to pray for anyone who asks. 

So, if you're around Bromley High Street every other Saturday from 10.00-11.00am you will find a team who will be delighted to pray with you. It wonâ€™t cost you anything, except a moment of your time.
