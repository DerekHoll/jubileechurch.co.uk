Jubilee Church is part of the community and we want to show support for people in and around our local area. 

We have teams who support <a href="#support-for-older-people">older people</a> and <a href="#college-pastors">college students</a>, and we help run the local <a href="#safer-neighbourhood-team">Safer Neighbourhoods team</a>. For those in financial hardship, we have <a href="#hardship-fund">a fund which can help to meet their needs</a>.

We run courses which give people a chance to <a href="#alpha">explore the meaning of life</a>. Once a year, we put on a <a href="#fun-in-the-sun">family event open to all of the community</a>, with live music, games, face painting, bouncy castles, a BBQ and plenty of refreshments.
