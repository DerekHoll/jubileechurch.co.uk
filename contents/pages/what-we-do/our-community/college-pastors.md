A number of members of Jubilee Church volunteer as College Pastors, at Bromley College of Higher Education. The team underwent training at the end of 2012 and since then have been providing support on weekly basis. The help patrol the college and local bus stops when the students leave to go home, as well as hosting a ‘faith and friendship’ group where students can come to discuss various topics and talk about any issues they have.
