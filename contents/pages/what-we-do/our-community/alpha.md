You may have heard about Alpha in the media, or seen it advertised on posters at bus stops, stations or churches. Alpha is a course designed primarily for people who aren’t ‘church goers’, and offers the opportunity for people to explore Christianity.

Typically these sessions involve sharing a meal together and hearing a short talk about an aspect of Christian faith, followed by a discussion where everyone is invited to share their thoughts and ask questions. There is no pressure, follow up or charge for the course.

Jubilee Church run Alpha courses regularly, so if you are interested in joining us to find out more about God, without any obligation, please contact us. You can also found out more about the Alpha course at [www.alpha.org]().
