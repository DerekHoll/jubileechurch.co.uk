There’s been a sharp increase in the number of people across the UK who cannot afford even the most basic amount of food. Food Banks everywhere are doing what they can to respond to this need. Our local Food Bank provides one week’s worth of emergency non-perishable food and other supplies to individuals and families facing crisis in the Bromley and Orpington area.

Here at Jubilee Church, we are giving our support by encouraging people to buy an extra item of food each week and bring it to the centre. All food and supply donations are then delivered to the Food Bank on a monthly basis to help those who need it in our local community. For more information, you can contact us directly, or you can find out more about the [Food Bank website](http://www.oakchurch.co.uk/foodbank.htm).
