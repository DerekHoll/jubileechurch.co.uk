Every fortnight, we meet in smaller groups to pray together, learn more about God through studying the Bible and discuss interesting and relevant issues. These meetings usually take place at someoneâ€™s home and are held on a couple of different evenings. A similar group is held on Saturday mornings for families with young  children who are not able to attend an evening meeting.
