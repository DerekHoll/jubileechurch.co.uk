Meeting on the third Saturday of each month, this group provides the opportunity for women to come together with the aim of encouraging personal growth, build confidence and develop friendships. There’s always something different taking place covering a wide variety of interests, so there’s something for everyone. IF takes place between 3.00-5.00pm at the Jubilee Centre. If you would like to find out more, please contact [Jean Cole](mailto:jean.ann.cole@gmail.com), or feel free to just come along and find out in person.
