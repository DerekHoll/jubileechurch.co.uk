Jubilee Church is made up of a group of Christians based in and around the Bromley Common area, based at the [Jubilee Centre](/pages/find-and-contact-us/#the-jubilee-centre) in Southlands Road.

Our reason for being together is found in one person – Jesus Christ. We share the common purpose of serving Jesus, and one another. We also want to serve our local community and do what we can to show God’s love; we believe that God loves our world. He really is interested in each and every person, whoever or wherever they are – and that includes Bromley!

We believe that a life lived for Jesus is simply the best – it may not always be easy, but knowing Jesus’ love in the difficult times, as well as the good times, makes such a difference.

Jubilee Church is a registered Charitable Incorporated Organisation ('CIO') and is part of the [Evangelical Alliance](http://www.eauk.org/) and [Pioneer network](http://www.pioneer.org.uk/) of churches.
