The Jubilee Centre stands on ground that has been home to a church for almost 100 years.

It has been the base for Jubilee Church since it joined with the Belmont Mission after their leaders invited Jubilee to take over the work on the old mission site. 

Jubilee Church was founded by Jim and Sylvia Holl and has met under various names and in a range of locations in the Bromley Common area since the 1970s. Now retired, Jim and Syliva are no longer involved in the day-to-day leadership of the church. However, both continue to play an active role in church life.

Belmont Mission started as a boys club in Bromley Common, and was founded in the 1920s by a young man called Kiff Balfour. The boys club developed into a church and was based in Southlands Road for almost 70 years.

Since coming together, we have lived through many exciting changes, including saying farewell to the old mission building which was in state of disrepair, and the opening of the new Jubilee Centre in November 2004. We have seen God do some amazing things in ways we could scarcely have imagined before. Jubilee Church has continued to develop and grow into the vibrant Christian community it is today.
